## Plant_Health_Monitoring
IoT system that monitors the health of plants in a greenhouse by analyzing live-streamed CCTV footage for signs of disease....

#1. Hardware Components

    Raspberry Pi: To serve as the central IoT hub.
    CCTV Camera: For live-streamed footage of the plants.
    Plant Health Sensor (e.g., Soil Moisture, pH, and Light Sensors): To monitor soil and light conditions.
    Temperature and Humidity Sensors (e.g., DHT11 or DHT22): To monitor the environment in the greenhouse.
    Power Supply: For the Raspberry Pi and other components.

#2. Software Components

    OpenCV: For real-time plant health monitoring from CCTV footage.
    TensorFlow/Keras: To train a basic machine learning model that can detect signs of disease.
    Flask/Django: To set up a simple server on Raspberry Pi for sensor data and CCTV footage.
    MQTT/HTTP Protocol: For communication between sensors and the Raspberry Pi.

#3. Basic Workflow

    Sensor Data Collection:
        Use Python libraries such as Adafruit_DHT (for temperature and humidity) and GPIO to interface with the plant health sensors.
        Collect real-time sensor data (e.g., soil moisture, temperature, and humidity) and log this information for analysis.

    CCTV Live Stream:
        Capture live video feed from the CCTV camera using cv2.VideoCapture() from the OpenCV library.
        Feed the footage to a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., CNN) that can classify plant health (healthy vs diseased) based on visual signs such as color changes, spots, or mold.

    Analyze Plant Health:
        Use a simple CNN model trained on plant disease datasets (like PlantVillage) to classify the plants as healthy or diseased.
        The model will analyze frames from the CCTV footage and provide a health status.
        Display sensor data and health status on a dashboard.

    Raspberry Pi Integration:
        Run the machine learning model and sensor data collection code on the Raspberry Pi.
        Use Flask/Django to create a web interface accessible via local network, showing the live sensor data and camera footage.
        Log the sensor data and analysis results to a cloud-based service (e.g., Firebase, AWS IoT) for remote monitoring.
